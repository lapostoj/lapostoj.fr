## Description
Personal website used as an online CV, portfolio and host for demos.
The goals is to used the latest and most modern technologies and framework to be at the edge, test and learn new things.
I will use Bootstrap 3 (Bootstrap 4 still lack some documentation and stability but might move to it later) and Angular 2 with Typescript. I know for the showcase part Angular is not really needed but it's still an opportunity to try it (first projct with it) and make a few maintenance things easier. Given that I will, at least for the moment, keep a version without Angular on a parallel branch.
It will also be an opportunity for me to learn more about hosting a website and the different offers about this.
